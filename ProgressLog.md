# Progress Log

## Week 1 (10/22/2017 - 10/28/2017)

#### Progress

For our first week, most of our time was spent figuring out what our project was going to be. We discussed various possible ideas, most of which revolved around sports in some way. After doing some investigating into available apis, we came to the conclusion that we would like to have an api that can be used by sites to find if there are any sporting events taking place near a location between two date ranges. We like to travel and would be nice to see if there are any sports games being played for the 4 major sports near where we are visiting.

We were able to do some searching and discovered that there is an api available called mysportsfeeds that has the data required to find sporting events between dates and had home team information.

After hashing out what our application would do, we created the repository and an initial Project Plan for our idea.

#### Obstacles

The first obstacles we hit were really just trying to figure out a good idea and some apis which would help with that idea.

#### Findings

We didn't have any findings this week since it was really just initial project planning

#### Learning Points

Some learning points that we took away from this week would be to start early. Coming up with an idea on short notice isn't easy. Luckily, we all are pretty creative so we came up with something pretty quickly.
